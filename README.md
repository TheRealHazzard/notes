## Notes Landing Page

## The framework you chose, along with any major plugins or packages you installed.

React with Tailwind CSS.

### The page load time of your landing page, and how you measured this time.

1.3s to first meaningful paint. Measured it on Lighthouse in Chrome.

### Any optimizations you did to decrease the load time or increase page performance.

Further optimization can be achieved by using videos instead of gifs and using formats like WebP instead of jepg for images. Minifying the js bundle should help as well.
